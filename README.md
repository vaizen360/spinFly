The following code is for bang assay recovery data collected from a number of ND2 mutant Drosophila flies that were
Crossed to the DGRP (Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel). The ND2 mutant flies carry a mutation in their mitochondrial
DNA rendering them less capable of coupling electrons to subunit 2 in the electron transport chain. In this dataset, we
Also include w118 wildtype flies as a control and uncrossed ND2 flies. The Bang assay functions by vortexing flies at a set
high velocity for a set amount of time and then recording how much time it takes to recover (i.e. start moving again and flying)
for each individual fly in a vial. In the dataset, there are values such as original.order (the order in which the flies were vortexed), 
the block (multiple blocks of lines were included to reduce the likelihood of experimental confounding factors), tag (different tag numbers 
are used for different lines - 23 had a total of 53 lines we investigated), vial (a number of vials for each line was used), N (number of flies), 
followed by fly 1-12. Thus, this allows us to look at changes in between groups versus within different groups during this analysis. 
The ultimate goal of this code is to take the original file and be able to transform the data to be able to upload it for genome wide association 
studies to identify SNPs associated with ameliorating or exacerbating the effects of ND2 alone upon "paralysis".
